# OFDM_using_Python
In this project, I have explained OFDM and implemented it in Python

## OFDM 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing(OFDM) is a multi-carrier modulation technique. It is the key technology used in the 4G/5G wireless communication system. OFDM divides a broadband channel into multiple parallel narrowband subchannels, where each subchannel carries a low data rate stream, which sum
